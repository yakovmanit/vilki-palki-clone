# Next.js + Feature-Sliced Design | Pure Template

## IMPORTANT

Do not delete the pages\* folder even if you are using App Router, deleting the pages folder
will result in a [build error](https://t.me/feature_sliced/1/107414).

In WebStorm you can mark a directory as [excluded](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/configuring-project-structure.html#content-root). After that, you wonâ€™t see it in shared files (like, for example, node_modules or .next)

## ADDITIONAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM (NOT RECOMMENDED)

If you don't like the empty "pages" folder in the project root, you can rename the pages layer (./src/pages)
for example to "pagesLayer" and then delete the pages folder from the project root 
(you will also have to change path aliases in tsconfig and similar).

**Use what you like best <3**
